From https://github.com/shicai/DenseNet-Caffe:

Due to compatibility reasons, several modifications have been made:

    BGR mean values [103.94,116.78,123.68] are subtracted
    scale: 0.017 is used, instead of the original std values for image preprocessing
    ceil_mode: false is used in the first pooling layers ('pool1')
