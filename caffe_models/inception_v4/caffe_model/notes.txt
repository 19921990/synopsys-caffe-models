Had to remove the layers at the end that had the "data" layer.
We don't support a named "data" layer for some reason.

The caffe model is "fake" and was generated by evgencnn.
We need a real one.

Pruned Graphs
1. inception_v4_convert.prototxt / Inception_V4_accuracy_drop_zero_1-77x_94-28.caffemodel (factor 1.77x)
2. inception_v4_convert.prototxt / Inception_V4_2-39x_94-04.caffemodel (factor 2.39x)
3. inception_v4_convert.prototxt / Inception_V4_accuracy_drop_0_005_2-4x_94-10.caffemodel (factor 2.4x)

Compressed graphs:
1. compressed_57p.prototxt / compressed_57p.caffemodel / compress_config_57p.py
- 57% of original MACs (factor 1.76)
- Latest updated one for SNPS Caffe can be found in compressed/1.76, the caffemodel is a symbol link to previous caffemodel

2. compressed_50p.prototxt / compressed_50p.caffemodel / compress_config_50p.py
- 50% of original MACs (factor 2.01)
- Latest updated one for SNPS Caffe can be found in compressed/2.01, the caffemodel is a symbol link to previous caffemodel
