We don't support a named "data" layer for some reason.

The caffe model is "fake" and was generated by evgencnn.
We need a real one.

Compressed graphs:
1. compressed-57p.prototxt / compressed-57p.caffemodel
- 57% of original MACs (factor 1.76)
- Latest updated one for SNPS Caffe can be found in compressed/1.76, the caffemodel is a symbol link to previous caffemodel

2. compressed-50p.prototxt / compressed-50p.caffemodel
- 50% of original MACs (factor 2.01)
- Latest updated one for SNPS Caffe can be found in compressed/2.01, the caffemodel is a symbol link to previous caffemodel
