Files created with:
    py create_yolo_prototxt.py yolo-voc.cfg yolo_voc.prototxt
after the region layer at the end is commented out.

The python scripts are in the /experiments/darknet directory.

Modify these lines:

    python_param {
      module: "yolov2"	 # change to this
      layer: "darknet_reorg"	 # change to this
      }

Then put caffe_models/yolo_v2_voc in your path to provide the python layers,
and create model file:

    py create_yolo_caffemodel.py -m yolo_voc.prototxt -w ../darknet_jul13/weights/yolo-voc.weights -o yolo_voc.caffemodel

Next, modify yolo.cc Region_parms namespace to include the 
anchors from the commented-out region layer in yol-voc.cfg:

        Result anchors[] = { 1.3221, 1.73145, 3.19275, ... 

Be sure to pass the yolo code the size of the image before network-size conversion.  
The reason for this is so we can print out the box coordinates
(upper-left, lower-right).
It's used here in the code:

    Image im = {img_h, img_w};

----------------------------------------


model-decomposed-v6.cfg/model-decomposed-v6-train_109000.weights is TomA's decomposed model.
model-decomposed-v6.prototxt is the caffe prototxt converted from model-decomposed-v6.cfg.
model-decomposed-v6-train_109000.caffemodel are caffe weights for said model converted from model-decomposed-v6-train_109000.weights.
